"""Core broker types: the contract provider modules, credential sources and transports implement.

A Provider is one integration, a credential Source (how the secret is obtained)
plus the Transports it offers (how it is delivered). The core discovers registered
providers and mounts every transport's routes, so adding an integration never
edits the core.
