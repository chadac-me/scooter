# The files viewer's frontend: React + @pierre/diffs (code), react-markdown
# (documents) and Shiki, built by Vite into one static tree that server.py serves
# as SCOOTER_FILES_STATIC. Everything is bundled, so the page needs no CDN and
# renders in a deployment with no egress; each Shiki grammar is its own chunk and
# loads only when a file in that language is opened.
